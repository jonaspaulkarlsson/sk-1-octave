# sk-1-octave
Octave switch for the Casio SK-1 keyboard

##### Work in progress, not yet tested! #####

The SK-1 is a great keyboard, but it's range is limited due to the short 2.5 octave keyboard.

Looking at the schematic in the service manual (http://www.burnkit2600.com/manuals/CASIO_SK-1_SRVC.pdf), the tuning is directly proportional to the MCU clock, generated by an LC oscillator.

The idea is to replace the inverter in the original oscillator with a CMOS inverter IC, add a clock divider to drop the frequency by four (down two octaves) and a multiplexer to select either the original or the divided frequency.
