# sk-1-octave
Octave switch for the Casio SK-1 keyboard

The SK-1 is a great keyboard, but it's range is limited due to the short 2.5 octave keyboard.

Looking at the schematic in the service manual (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjykqe8k6nvAhXKwosKHUbpAYcQFjAAegQICxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polynominal.com%2Fcasio-sk-1%2Fcasio-sk1-service-manual.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2tIbBTfMuOw3-Z8u4iDqqa), the tuning is directly proportional to the MCU clock, generated by an LC oscillator.

The idea is to replace the inverter in the original oscillator with a CMOS inverter IC, add a clock divider to drop the frequency by four (down two octaves) and a multiplexer to select either the original or the divided frequency.
